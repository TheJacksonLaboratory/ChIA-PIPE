*
* Description:
* This header file contains class declarations and other definitions for the 
* randomc class library of uniform random number generators in C++ language.
*
* Overview of classes:
* ====================
*
* class CRandomMersenne:
* Random number generator of type Mersenne twister.
* Source file mersenne.cpp
*
* class CRandomMother:
* Random number generator of type Mother-of-All (Multiply with carry).
* Source file mother.cpp
*
* class CRandomSFMT:
* Random number generator of type SIMD-oriented Fast Mersenne Twister.
* The class definition is not included here because it is not
* portable to all platforms. See sfmt.h and sfmt.cpp for details.
*
* Member functions (methods):
* ===========================
*
* All these classes have identical member functions:
*
* Constructor(int seed):
* The seed can be any integer. The time may be used as seed.
* Executing a program twice with the same seed will give the same sequence 
* of random numbers. A different seed will give a different sequence.
*
* void RandomInit(int seed);
* Re-initializes the random number generator with a new seed.
*
* void RandomInitByArray(int const seeds[], int NumSeeds);
* In CRandomMersenne and CRandomSFMT only: Use this function if you want 
* to initialize with a seed with more than 32 bits. All bits in the seeds[]
* array will influence the sequence of random numbers generated. NumSeeds 
* is the number of entries in the seeds[] array.
*
* double Random();
* Gives a floating point random number in the interval 0 <= x < 1.
* The resolution is 32 bits in CRandomMother and CRandomMersenne, and
* 52 bits in CRandomSFMT.
*
* int IRandom(int min, int max);
* Gives an integer random number in the interval min <= x <= max.
* (max-min < MAXINT).
* The precision is 2^-32 (defined as the difference in frequency between 
* possible output values). The frequencies are exact if max-min+1 is a
* power of 2.
*
* int IRandomX(int min, int max);
* Same as IRandom, but exact. In CRandomMersenne and CRandomSFMT only.
* The frequencies of all output values are exactly the same for an 
* infinitely long sequence. (Only relevant for extremely long sequences).
*
* uint32_t BRandom();
* Gives 32 random bits. 
*
*
* Example:
* ========
* The file EX-RAN.CPP contains an example of how to generate random numbers.
*
*
* Library version:
* ================
* Optimized versions of these random number generators are provided as function
* libraries in randoma.zip. These function libraries are coded in assembly
* language and support only x86 platforms, including 32-bit and 64-bit
* Windows, Linux, BSD, Mac OS-X (Intel based). Use randoma.h from randoma.zip
*
*
* Non-uniform random number generators:
* =====================================
* Random number generators with various non-uniform distributions are 
* available in stocc.zip (www.agner.org/random).
*
*
* Further documentation:
* ======================
* The file ran-instructions.pdf contains further documentation and 
* instructions for these random number generators.
